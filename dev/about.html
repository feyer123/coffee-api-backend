    <h2>Our Story</h2>
     <p><strong>Essential Services Coffee Roasters</strong> was founded in 2020, in the midst of the pandemic, during a time when access to life’s essentials was anything but guaranteed. What began as a small home-roasting operation became a mission: to bring exceptional coffee to people - even in the most remote places - who value quality, adventure, and connection.</p>

  <p>Born out of necessity, fueled by passion, and shaped by the wild places we love, our roasting philosophy is rooted in three pillars: <strong>adventure, balance, and conservation</strong>.</p>

  <p>Each cup of Essential Services coffee is more than just a morning ritual - it's a connection. To a community that shares a love for the outdoors, a thirst for exploration, and a deep respect for nature. Whether you're carving powder turns in the Tetons, mountain biking dusty singletrack, or casting for cutthroat trout, Essential Services is the reliable and delicious fuel for your journey.</p>

  <h3>Freshness You Can Taste</h3>
  <p>We roast to order to ensure your coffee hits your doorstep at peak flavor. Most coffee is best between 4 to 14 days after roasting, so we schedule your roast date with that window in mind. After you place your order, we’ll confirm your next available roast date and ship it shortly after. Your beans arrive fresh, full of flavor, and ready for your next adventure.</p>

  <h3>Small Batch. Big Flavor.</h3>
  <p>Unlike industrial roasters who rely on automation and volume, we hand-roast every small batch with precision and care. There are no shortcuts, just honest craftsmanship focused on unlocking the natural character of each bean. We never over-roast or blend away the uniqueness. And every bag is stamped with its roast date, so you know exactly how fresh your coffee is when it arrives.</p>
