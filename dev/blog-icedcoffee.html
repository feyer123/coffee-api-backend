  <h2>3 Ways to Make Great Iced Coffee at Home</h2>
  <img src="images/icedpour.jpg" alt="Pouring coffee over ice in a V60" class="responsive-img">

  <p>At EssentialServices.coffee, we believe good coffee should work just as hard as you do—even when it’s cold. When summer hits, hot brews take a back seat to iced coffee, but that doesn’t mean cutting corners on quality. There are a few solid ways to do it right, each with its own rhythm and result.</p>

  <p>In this post, we’ll walk through three reliable methods for making great iced coffee at home:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pour Over Over Ice (Japanese-style)</strong> – quick, clean, and vibrant</li>
      <li><strong>Chilled Brewed Coffee</strong> – straightforward and flexible</li>
      <li><strong>Cold Brew</strong> – low-effort, full-bodied, and easy to prep ahead</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>Whether you want something crisp on demand, something to chill in the fridge, or a slow-steeped brew to sip all week, this guide lays out the options so you can find the one that fits your routine.</p>

  <h2>Each Method at a Glance</h2>
  <p>Each of these methods starts with the same goal—good beans, clean water, and a thoughtful approach—but they take different paths to get there. You don’t need fancy gear or a barista badge, just a little know-how and a willingness to experiment. Below, we’ll break down what each method involves, what it tastes like, and when it might fit best into your day.</p>

  <h3>1. Pour Over Over Ice (Japanese-Style Iced Coffee)</h3>
  <p><strong>Quick. Bright. Balanced.</strong></p>
  <p>This method preserves brightness and aromatics in a way cold brew doesn’t, making it great for light or medium roasts with complex notes.</p>
  <p><strong>How to Make It:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use your usual pour-over setup (like a V60 or Chemex).</li>
    <li>Halve the brew water and replace the other half with ice in your carafe.</li>
    <li>Example: 150g hot water + 150g ice for a 300g brew.</li>
    <li>Brew as normal, pouring slowly and evenly over your grounds.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Pro Tips:</strong> Use filtered ice. Brew a little stronger to offset dilution.</p>
  <p><strong>Best For:</strong> Quick single cups, delicate roasts, and immediate drinking.</p>

  <h3>2. Chilled Brewed Coffee</h3>
  <p><strong>Simple. Familiar. Satisfying.</strong></p>
  <p>This is a great way to use leftover hot brew or plan ahead without much effort.</p>
  <p><strong>How to Make It:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Brew coffee as normal (drip, French press, Aeropress, etc.).</li>
    <li>Cool to room temp, then refrigerate.</li>
    <li>Serve over ice when ready.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Pro Tips:</strong> Store in a sealed jar. Brew slightly stronger to hold up to ice.</p>
  <p><strong>Best For:</strong> Repurposing extra coffee, mellow flavors, low-maintenance prep.</p>

  <h3>3. Cold Brew</h3>
  <p><strong>Smooth. Low-Acid. Prep-Friendly.</strong></p>
  <p>Cold brew is brewed entirely without heat, resulting in a smooth, sweet, and low-acid cup that’s easy to keep on hand.</p>
  <p><strong>How to Make It:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Combine coarsely ground coffee with cold, filtered water (1:4 to 1:8 ratio).</li>
    <li>Stir, cover, and steep for 12–18 hours.</li>
    <li>Strain through a filter or cheesecloth and store.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Pro Tips:</strong> Use darker roasts for rich notes. Make concentrate to dilute later.</p>
  <p><strong>Best For:</strong> Big batches, smooth sippers, and grab-and-go convenience.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>There’s no one “right” way to make iced coffee—just the right one for you, your beans, and your day. Whether you're pouring hot over ice, chilling leftover brew, or planning ahead with cold brew, each method brings something worth savoring.</p>
  <p>At EssentialServices.coffee, we roast to order so you get the best flavor no matter how you brew. Lighter roasts shine in pour overs, while darker profiles hold their own beautifully in cold brew.</p>
